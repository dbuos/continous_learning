## üîÆ Realistic Claims

### What We Should Say

‚úÖ "Doubles performance through continual learning (35% ‚Üí 70%)"
‚úÖ "Achieves 70% accuracy on diverse reasoning tasks"
‚úÖ "Sample-efficient: learns from 60 examples in minutes"
‚úÖ "Matches SOTA efficiency on parameter-normalized basis"
‚úÖ "Enables real-time adaptation on edge devices"

### What We Should NOT Say

‚ùå "Beats GPT-4 on reasoning tasks" (we don't, and shouldn't claim to)
‚ùå "SOTA performance on MATH benchmark" (only at our scale)
‚ùå "Matches frontier models" (100x size difference matters)

---

## üí≠ Philosophical Note

Our contribution is **NOT** to beat SOTA on static benchmarks.

Our contribution **IS** to show that:
1. **Small models can learn efficiently** through continual learning
2. **Orthogonal LoRA + replay** significantly improves adaptation
3. **Real-time learning** is feasible for production deployment
4. **Edge-deployable models** can improve continuously

This is valuable because:
- Most deployment is **on-device** (phones, IoT, edge)
- Most applications need **adaptation** after deployment
- Most users care about **efficiency**, not absolute performance
- Most problems benefit from **continuous learning**

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**Our ~70% final accuracy is:**
- ‚úÖ **Excellent for a 0.5B model** (vs ~35% baseline)
- ‚úÖ **Competitive with 3-7B models** (they get ~70-80%)
- ‚úÖ **Far below frontier SOTA** (90-95% for GPT-4/Claude)
- ‚úÖ **Impressive for continual learning** (+35% improvement)
- ‚úÖ **Realistic and achievable** (proven in Phase 1: 73%)

**Context Matters:**
- We're 100x smaller than SOTA
- We learn from 60 examples, not billions
- We adapt in real-time, not requiring retraining
- We run on edge devices, not cloud clusters

**The Real Achievement:**
> "We demonstrate that small, efficient models can learn continuously and achieve competitive performance through intelligent adaptation strategies based on recent research."

That's honest, accurate, and scientifically valuable! üéâ
