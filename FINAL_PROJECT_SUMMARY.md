## üß™ Advanced Reasoning Arena

### Task Types (8 total, up from 5)

| Task Type | Difficulty | Steps | Example |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Multi-step Math** | 2-4 | 2-4 | "Buy 10 items at $5 each, get 20% discount. How much?" |
| **Algebraic Reasoning** | 2-3 | 2 | "Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22" |
| **Logical Deduction** | 3 | 2-3 | "A > B, B > C. Who is greatest?" |
| **Counterfactual** | 3-4 | 2 | "If Alice studied she'd score 90, but she scored 75..." |
| **Analogy** | 2-4 | 1 | "cat:kitten::dog:?" |
| **Code Reasoning** | 2-3 | 2 | "What does this code output?" |
| **Probability** | 3 | 1-2 | "Bag has 10 balls, 3 red. P(red)?" |
| **Geometry** | 1-2 | 1-2 | "Rectangle 5√ó8. Area?" |

### Key Features

**Difficulty Levels:**
```python
1 = Easy (basic arithmetic, simple logic)
2 = Medium (two-step problems)
3 = Moderate (multi-step, some complexity)
4 = Hard (complex multi-step)
5 = Very Hard (advanced reasoning)
```

**Curriculum Learning:**
```python
arena.generate_curriculum(
    n_tasks=100,
    start_difficulty=1,
    end_difficulty=5
)
# Generates: diff=1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5...
```

**Multi-Step Problems:**
```
Question: A shopkeeper buys an item for $100.
          He marks it up by 30% but then gives a 20% discount.
          What is his profit?

Solution Steps:
Step 1: Marked price = $100 + 30% = $130
Step 2: Discount = 20% of $130 = $26
Step 3: Selling price = $130 - $26 = $104
Step 4: Profit = $104 - $100 = $4

Answer: $4
```

## üî¨ Orthogonal LoRA with Experience Replay

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Orthogonality Regularization
```python
def _compute_orthogonality_loss(self):
    """
    Penalize parameter updates that aren't orthogonal
    to initial parameters
    """
    orth_loss = 0
    for name, param in current_params:
        current_flat = param.view(-1)
        initial_flat = initial_params[name].view(-1)

        # Compute cosine similarity
        cos_sim = F.cosine_similarity(current_flat, initial_flat)

        # Penalize non-orthogonality (cos_sim should be ~0)
        orth_loss += cos_sim ** 2

    return orth_loss

# Total loss
loss = task_loss + orthogonal_reg * orth_loss
```

**Why it works:**
- New knowledge stored in orthogonal subspace
- Minimizes interference with old knowledge
- Reduces catastrophic forgetting

#### 2. Experience Replay Buffer
```python
class ExperienceReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity=300, sample_size=5):
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)

    def add(self, question, answer, task_type):
        """Store each example"""
        self.buffer.append({'question': q, 'answer': a, ...})

    def sample(self, n=5):
        """Randomly sample past examples"""
        return random.sample(self.buffer, n)

# During training
current_loss = compute_loss(current_task)
replay_samples = buffer.sample(5)
replay_loss = compute_loss(replay_samples)

# Combine losses (70% current, 30% replay)
total_loss = 0.7 * current_loss + 0.3 * replay_loss
```

**Why it works:**
- Rehearses past tasks during training
- Maintains performance on earlier tasks
- Standard technique in continual learning

#### 3. Adaptive Learning Rate
```python
def adaptive_lr(base_lr, difficulty):
    """
    Harder problems ‚Üí lower LR for stability
    Easier problems ‚Üí higher LR for faster learning
    """
    scale = 1.0 - (difficulty - 1) * 0.1
    # difficulty=1 ‚Üí scale=1.0 (full LR)
    # difficulty=5 ‚Üí scale=0.6 (60% LR)
    return base_lr * scale
```

**Why it works:**
- Hard problems are more sensitive to LR
- Prevents instability on complex tasks
- Faster convergence on easy tasks
