## System Architecture

### 1. Soft Prompting with Gradient Descent

The core innovation is using **soft prompts** (continuous, learnable embeddings) that are prepended to the input and optimized via gradient descent based on task feedback.

```
Architecture Flow:
[Soft Prompt Embeddings] + [Input Text Embeddings] → LLM → Response
            ↓
    Gradient Descent Update
            ↑
      [Loss Signal]
```

**Key Components:**
- **Learnable Parameters**: 8 soft prompt tokens × 2048 dimensions = 16,384 parameters
- **Frozen Base Model**: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (1.1B parameters frozen)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy on next-token prediction

### 2. Logic Reasoning Arena

A diverse reasoning environment testing multiple cognitive capabilities:

| Task Type | Description | Example | Difficulty |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Comparison** | Transitive reasoning (A > B > C) | "Alice is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Charlie. Who is tallest?" | Medium |
| **Sequence** | Pattern recognition | "What comes next: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?" | Medium |
| **Causal** | Cause-effect reasoning | "If it rains, ground gets wet. It rained. Did ground get wet?" | Low |
| **Math Word Problems** | Arithmetic reasoning | "Alice has 5 apples. Bob gives her 4 more. How many total?" | Low |
| **Logic Grid** | Constraint satisfaction | "Alice likes red. Bob doesn't like red. What does Charlie like?" | Medium |

### 3. Continuous Learning Loop

```python
for episode in range(n_episodes):
    # 1. Generate new task
    task = arena.generate_task()

    # 2. Get prediction (before learning)
    prediction_before = agent.generate_response(task.question)

    # 3. Compute loss and update soft prompts via gradient descent
    loss = agent.compute_loss(task.question, task.answer)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # 4. Get prediction (after learning)
    prediction_after = agent.generate_response(task.question)

    # 5. Periodic evaluation on held-out set
    if episode % eval_interval == 0:
        evaluate(agent, eval_tasks)
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: NaN Losses

**Problem**: Initial implementation produced NaN losses immediately

**Root Cause**:
- Dtype mismatch (float16 model, float32 soft prompts)
- Poor label alignment in loss computation

**Solution**:
- Use float32 throughout for stability
- Simplified loss computation with better alignment
- Added gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)

### Challenge 2: Model Compatibility

**Problem**: LiquidAI models produced unstable gradients

**Finding**: Not all models work well with soft prompting
- GPT-2: Too small, not instruction-tuned
- LiquidAI: Numerical instability
- TinyLlama: ✓ Worked well (instruction-tuned, stable)

**Lesson**: Use instruction-tuned models for best results

### Challenge 3: Learning Signal

**Problem**: Initial accuracy improvements were just noise

**Solution**:
- Verified loss is decreasing (not NaN)
- Increased training episodes (60 vs 20)
- Used consistent evaluation set

### 3. Efficiency vs Performance Tradeoff

| Approach | Trainable Params | Memory | Speed | Accuracy Gain |
|----------|------------------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Full Fine-tuning | 1.1B | High | Slow | High |
| LoRA | ~1M | Medium | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Soft Prompting** | **16K** | **Low** | **Fast** | **Medium** |

Soft prompting offers the best efficiency for online learning scenarios.
