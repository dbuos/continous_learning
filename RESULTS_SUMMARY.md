## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Train/Eval Split (Critical!)

**Problem Solved:** Previous implementation had train/eval overlap, inflating metrics.

**Solution:**
```python
# Generate large pool
all_tasks = arena.generate_batch(n=train + eval + buffer, mix=True)

# STRICT SEPARATION - no overlap!
eval_tasks = all_tasks[:n_eval]           # Held-out set
train_tasks = all_tasks[n_eval:]          # Training pool

# Verify no overlap
assert set(eval_tasks).isdisjoint(set(train_tasks))
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate generalization metrics
- ‚úÖ No data leakage
- ‚úÖ True test of learning ability

### LoRA Configuration

**Why LoRA over Soft Prompting?**

| Aspect | Soft Prompting | LoRA |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Trainable Params | ~16K | ~1M |
| Stability | Moderate | High ‚úÖ |
| Model Compatibility | Limited | Broad ‚úÖ |
| Learning Capacity | Low | Medium ‚úÖ |
| Memory Efficiency | Excellent | Good |

**LoRA Setup:**
```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=16,              # Rank (higher = more capacity)
    lora_alpha=32,     # Scaling factor
    lora_dropout=0.1,  # Regularization
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Attention layers
    bias="none",
)
```

**Gradient Descent:**
```python
# Compute loss (teacher forcing)
loss = model(input_ids=ids, labels=ids).loss

# Backprop + update
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(params, max_norm=1.0)  # Stability
optimizer.step()
```
